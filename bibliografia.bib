	abstract = {{Cloud computing has become another buzzword after Web 2.0. However, there are dozens of different definitions for cloud computing and there seems to be no consensus on what a cloud is. On the other hand, cloud computing is not a completely new concept; it has intricate connection to the relatively new but thirteen-year established grid computing paradigm, and other relevant technologies such as utility computing, cluster computing, and distributed systems in general. This paper strives to compare and contrast cloud computing with grid computing from various angles and give insights into the essential characteristics of both.}},

@phdthesis{rest,
    abstract = {{The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The Web has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series of modifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspects of the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for the modern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment.
Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best to partition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, how information is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, and how all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of networkbased application software through principled use of architectural constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. An architectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints.

This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture via architectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architectural design of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles for network-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architectural properties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style and describe how REST has been used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web. REST emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles.
Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying REST to the design of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequent deployment in Web client and server software.}},

@article{kepler_system,
    abstract = {{Many scientific disciplines are now data and information driven, and new scientific knowledge is often gained by scientists putting together data analysis and knowledge discovery 'pipelines'. A related trend is that more and more scientific communities realize the benefits of sharing their data and computational services, and are thus contributing to a distributed data and computational community infrastructure (a.k.a. 'the Grid'). However, this infrastructure is only a means to an end and ideally scientists should not be too concerned with its existence. The goal is for scientists to focus on development and use of what we call scientific workflows. These are networks of analytical steps that may involve, e.g., database access and querying steps, data analysis and mining steps, and many other steps including computationally intensive jobs on high-performance cluster computers. In this paper we describe characteristics of and requirements for scientific workflows as identified in a number of our application projects. We then elaborate on Kepler, a particular scientific workflow system, currently under development across a number of scientific data management projects. We describe some key features of Kepler and its underlying Ptolemy II system, planned extensions, and areas of future research. Kepler is a community-driven, open source project, and we always welcome related projects and new contributors to join. Copyright {\copyright} 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

    abstract = {This volume describes the software architecture of Ptolemy II. The first chapter covers the kernel package, which provides a set of Java classes supporting clustered graph topologies for models. Cluster graphs provide a very general abstract syntax for component-based modeling, without assuming or imposing any semantics on the models. The actor package begins to add semantics by providing basic infrastructure for data transport between components. The data package provides classes to encapsulate the data that is transported. It also provides an extensible type system and an interpreted expression language. The graph package provides graph-theoretic algorithms that are used in the type system and by schedulers in the individual domains. The model transformation package provides a mechanism to systematically transform models by means of graph rewriting. The plot package provides a visual data plotting utility that is used in many of the applets and applications. The codegen package is a templated based code generator similar to the Ptolemy Classic code generators. The copernicus package is a code generator that performs static analysis on Java class files to produce smaller, faster executable models. Volume 1 gives an introduction to Ptolemy II, including tutorials on the use of the software, and volume 3 describes the domains, each of which implements a model of computation.}
